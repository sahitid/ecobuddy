# EcoBuddy 🌱

## About
EcoBuddy is a mobile application that offers ways for users to gain points by practicing sustainable living and completing eco-friendly exercises. Users can engage in five simple daily challenges that include reducing single-use plastic, saving water, recycling or reusing household items, taking public transit, or planting trees. When the challenge cards are clicked, users can read a description of the challenge to gain more insight into issues of plastic waste, deforestation, greenhouse gases, and water scarcity. The app’s dashboard also serves as a home for the user’s points which are updated every time a new challenge is completed. Moreover, the app’s EcoQuiz serves as a carbon tracker tool where users can input their daily activities - such as commuting, energy usage, and diet - in order to estimate and track their carbon footprint over time. This estimated value allows the user to compare themselves to others around the world and make better decisions when it comes to staying eco-friendly. My app is scalable and can easily have dozens of additional “Green Challenges” added to the dashboard screen. In the future development of the app, users can be put on a points leaderboard and given streaks based on their activities.
